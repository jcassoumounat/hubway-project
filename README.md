# Hubway Project
Analysis of bike share data from the Boston's Hubway program, a final project for University of Washington's Data Science 350 course. In  this project I modeled how station elevation effected station popularity, how the weather and time influenced the number of trips taken, and how membership and age affected trip duration.

Code to generate graphs and models can be found in Michael Patterson - Final Project.R. I created an R Jupyter notebook to display my analyses with code.
